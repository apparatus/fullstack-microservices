# Spike 1

* Simplest most common libs possible
* jQuery
* bootstrap
* ignores the styling issue


## Planned Spikes

### Spike 2

* polymer
* this time encapsulate styles
* separate structure from skin
* use polymer app toolbox components
* may need a component manager (`npm`? `component`?)

### Spike 3

* react
* react-bootstrap with css modules...
* etc.
* possibly include a Spike 3.5 with a react-native example for mobile

### Spike 4

* minimalism with vanilla JS and vdom
